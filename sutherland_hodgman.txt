FOR clipping line on the convex clipping polygon
	FOR every edge in the arbitrary polygon
	// walk the polygon
	// the case is determined by evaluating the 
	// decision function at the end points of the line
	// as in the midpoint algorithm
		IF edge crosses the clipping line
			IF crossing from inside --> outside
				output new vertex at crossing point
			ENDIF
			IF crossing from outside --> inside
				output new vertex at crossing point and end vertex
			ENDIF
		ELSE
			IF inside clipping line
				output end vertex
			ENDIF
			IF outside clipping line
				do nothing
		ENDIF
	ENDFOR
ENDFOR
